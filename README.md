# TIC TAC TOE Game

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple game for two players. The game involves 2 players placing their respective symbols in a 4x4 grid with 16 square fields. 

## INTRODUCTION

In this project two "AI’s" compete against each other in an extended version of the game Tic-Tac-Toe. At the beginning of the game one square is blacked out and can not be used by either one of the players. In alternating turns the AI’s mark one square with either an X or an O, trying to achieve "four-in-a-row" and win the game. The player who manages to place four of their symbols in horizontal/vertical/diagonal row wins the game. If either player fails to do so the game ends in a draw. If both the people always play their optimal strategies the game always ends in a draw. The figure below shows the depiction of how the Tic Tac Toe game is being played
between the two AI’s in the project.
